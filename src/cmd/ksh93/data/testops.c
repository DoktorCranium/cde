"[+NAME?test, [ - evaluate expression]"
"[+DESCRIPTION?\btest\b evaluates expressions and returns its result using the "
	"exit status. Option parsing is not performed; all arguments, "
	"including \b--\b, are processed as operands. It is essential to quote "
	"expression arguments to suppress empty removal, field splitting, file "
	"name generation, and constructs such as redirection. If the command "
	"is invoked as \b[\b, a final \b]]\b argument is required and "
	"discarded. The evaluation of the expression depends on the number of "
	"operands, as follows:]"
"{"
	"[+0?Evaluates to false.]"
	"[+1?True if argument is not an empty string.]"
	"[+2?If first operand is \b!\b, the result is True if the second "
		"operand is an empty string. Otherwise, it is evaluated "
		"as one of the unary expressions defined below. If the "
		"unary operator is invalid and the second argument is \b--\b, "
		"then the first argument is processed as a \bgetopts\b(1) "
		"help option.]"
	"[+3?If first operand is \b!\b, the result is True if the second "
		"and third operand evaluated as a unary expression is False. "
		"Otherwise, the three operands are evaluated as one of the "
		"binary expressions listed below.]"
	"[+4?If first operand is \b!\b, the result is True if the next "
		"three operands are a valid binary expression that is False.]"
