# Downloading

Downloading this release:

CDE may be downloaded in source form from the Common Desktop
Environment website:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdesktopenv/

Or via git:

git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/cdesktopenv/code CDE

The git repository will always be more up to date than the
downloadable tarballs we make available, so if you have problems,
please try the latest version from git master.

Note also that the master branch may be unstable, so your milage may
vary.

# Compiling

Complete build and installation instructions can be found on the CDE
wiki:

http://sourceforge.net/p/cdesktopenv/wiki/Home/

Please go there and read the appropriate section(s) for your OS (Linux
or FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD currently) prior to attmpting to build it.

There are a variety of dependencies that must be met, as well as
specific set up steps required to build, especially relating localization
and locales.

Do not expect to just type 'make' and have it actually work without
meeting the prerequisites and following the correct steps as spelled
out on the wiki.

There are also a lot of other documents and information there that you
might find useful.

Assuming you've met all of the requirements regarding packages needed
for the build, you can follow the standard autoconf method:

```
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

NOTE: BSD users must currently install and use gmake to compile, as
well as specify the location of the TCL libraries and headers.  So
the instructions for them would looke like:

```
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --with-tcl=/usr/local/lib/tcl8.6 MAKE="gmake"
$ gmake
$ sudo gmake install
```
